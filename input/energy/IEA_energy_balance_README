IEA energy bal READ ME

The balance correction deals with positive and negative values in the
IEA energy balance data. These are calculated from the World EBalance 2005.xls.
In the World EBalance 2005, negative values note an input to an energy
transformation process while positive values note output.
In IEA_energy_balance_factor.csv, the balance_correction column also has negative
values for inputs to energy transformation (like electricity producers or petroleum refining)
and positive values for outputs.
