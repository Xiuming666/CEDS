This folder contains data files with default emissions factors and default emission factor parameters (sulfur content, ash retention, and control percentage) to be added to the data system.
This include both input data files and files written out by various scripts in module B.


These data files are added to the data system in Module B, scripts
	B1.2.add_comb_control_percent.R
	B1.2.add_comb_default_EF.R
	B1.2.add_SO2_comb_S_content_ash.R

These scripts automatically load data files based on file naming conventions below

Types of data are filtered based on the naming conventions below
sulfur content 
	contains "s_content"
	example:
ash content 
	contains “_s_ash_ret"
	example:
default efs 
	contain "_EF"
	example:
control percent 
	contains ”_control_percent"
	example:

Files added to the system by the users (unprocessed by scripts) should begin with “U_”
	example: U_S_Africa_coal_electricity_SO2_ash_ret.csv

Files that are processed by scripts in the system begin with “B.[em]_”
	example: “B.SO2_GAINS_control_percent.csv”

Files that begin with "B." will be deleted on make clean-all or make clean-modB

Files will be process in alphabetical order.
(If there is a reason that user files need to be run before the system-generated files, then they could be named "AU_...").
